			<p> My interest in chemistry started early as a child. Growing up in Malaysia with a mom who was a biochemistry professor, I was exposed to the lab environment and STEM research fields which fanned my passion for sciences in all fields, I remember discussing with some of the grad students about their work. After moving to Illinois for high school, I was an avid member of our science club. </p>

      <p>  I initially decided to pursue an academic career in computer science starting with my BSc at the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign from 2012-2017 due to interest in Video Games, but discovered that there was huge difference between coding video games and playing video games (a shocker, I know). Feeling unsatisfied with my trajectory remembering my enjoyment and affinity to Chemistry, I decided to switch my field of study after my second year and even performed some undergraduate research during my time there.">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p> After graduating and working in the grease and lubricant industry as a lab technician for a couple of years I decided to do a PhD in physical chemistry at the University of California, Riverside (2019-2025) in the lab of Prof. Boniface Fokwa. While there, I decided to leverage my prior experience as a computer scientist and had the opportunity to jumpstart and lead a new project in the group training ML algorithms inorganic compound data from databases to predict their magnetic properties. the group’s first project in data science More of the lab’s research can be seen here. </b>

        <!-- Discuss how, on top of that, I went through cardiac arrest. It made me re-think my career trajectory. I actually became a farmer for a bit. Main conclusion is that I want to do work that has a real-world impact (like feeding people, sustainable practices, and community building). I decided to finish what I started (my PhD) but I would actively prepared myself for a transition into industry. </p> -->
