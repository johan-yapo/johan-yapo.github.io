        <!-- <p>
          Stargazing into the clear Kansas skies (Figure 1) throughout my childhood inspired me to pursue an academic career in astrophysics. My first step towards this goal was studying astrophysics at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW). I quickly realized that much of <b>modern astrophysics research is essentially applied data science </b>.
         </p> -->




        <!-- <p>
          At UW I worked with Professor Matthew McQuinn to study the large-scale evolution of the universe. This experience established a foundation for data science moving forward. I first acquired domain knowledge via literature reviews and advice from leading experts. Then I used this knowledge to inform an interesting and novel project goal. <b>I collected large datasets from an astronomical observatory, developed a pipeline in Python to process this data, and then applied advanced statistical methods to derive meaningful insights from the data</b>. From these insights we better constrained the thermal evolution of the universe in a way that has never been done before. I published this work in the peer-reviewed journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Read my paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.2423W/abstract">here</a>. -->

          <!-- Upon gradutating with a BSc in astrophysics from UW, I pursued a PhD in physics from the University of California, Riverside. During my PhD, I worked on two classes of projects that uniquely add to my data scientist skillset: (1) modeling emissions from cosmological phenomena and (2) artificial intelligence assisted super-resolution cosmological simulations. In project 1, <b>I implemented dimensionality reduction techniques and extensive validation testing to produce a reliable model that reduces computational cost by a factor of 10,000</b>. This model was then used to generate realistic mock images that inform the stakeholders (observational astronomers) on current and future observational prospects. We found that end of reionization (a pivotal moment in cosmic history that has never been directly detected) is likely detectable with a dedicated program. See figure 2 for an example mock image. This project resulted in 2 first-authored publications.

          <!-- <p>
            In project 2 of my PhD, I moved towards the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to assist cosmological simulations. I led a deep learning based project to super-resolve 3-dimensional cosmological simulations to 8 times higher resolution over a billion years of cosmic evolution. For example, I show the time evolution of the low and high resolution training pairs that I created in figure 3 and 4 respectively. The enormous spatial dynamic range would allow simulations simultaneously model small scales (think small, faint galaxies) as well as the large scales (think rare sources like massive, bright galaxies). I used the <a href="https://www.globus.org/data-transfer">Globus data transfer tool</a> to move massive Tb-size cosmological simulation data files and then preprocessed these simulations in preparation for model training. Then <b>I trained a generative-adversarial DL model (styleGAN) written using Pytorch on GPU nodes of the Frontera supercomputer, the fastest academic supercomputer in the United States </b>. I monitored the training of the generator and discriminator using Tensorboard to ensure proper progress was being made. I decided to graduate before completing this project but I have made significant progress in preprocessing and early model training. I have trained other researchers that will complete this project in the near future.

            <!-- <h2 class="text-left">Why transition into industry?</h2>
            <p> The main reason I am transitioning into industry is to do work that has a tangible real-world impact. Astrophysics research in academia is slow and has little direct impact on humanity. I am interested in working on faster-paced projects (taking months, not years to complete) with a company that directly helps people. I have done a variety of personal projects that align with this vision that I would be interested in pursuing further. For example, I have done projects <a href="https://github.com/bayu-wilson/Brain_Tumor_GAN">augmenting medical image datasets with generative AI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bayu-wilson/MoveNet_project">tracking human movements with computer vision</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bayu-wilson/bayesian_marketing_analysis">marketing decision analysis using Bayesian statistics</a>. Through these projects, I have generalized the data science skills developed throughout my PhD for tackling real-world business problems.

                <!-- <h2>An Introduction to My Academic Work in Astronomy</h2>
                <p>The first luminous sources in the universe ionized and heated the majority of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in a process called reionization. A detailed description of how exactly reionization took place has yet to be formulated. In particular, current measurements and models of the morphology and timing of the end of reionization are still at odds with each other. Understanding reionization is crucial for insights into the first sources of ionizing radiation in the universe and the subsequent regulation of galaxy formation.</p>

                <p>I received a B.S. in Astronomy & Physics from the University of Washington, Seattle in 2019, where I was an undergraduate research assistant for Professor Matthew McQuinn. I led a study on the thermal history of the IGM using advanced statistical methods and found that hydrogen reionization is complete while helium-II reionization is still ongoing around 2 billion years after the big bang. Read more about it <a href="matt.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Physics at the University of California, Riverside, working with Professor Anson D’Aloisio. I focus on radiative transfer simulations to test and build models of hydrogen reionization. I have developed a detailed model of I-front fluorescence for large cosmological simulations. Read more about it <a href="anson.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Recently, I have become interested in applying machine learning to cosmological simulations. I lead a project to enhance low-resolution dark matter simulations to predict small-scale structure formation in large cosmological volumes. This deep-learning model significantly reduces computational demand compared to standard methods while remaining statistically validated on test datasets.</p>

                <p>I am eager to apply my analytical and computational skills developed through my PhD to industry.
